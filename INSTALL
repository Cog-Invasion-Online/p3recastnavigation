Installation Instructions
*************************
To build and install p3recastnavigation, follow these instructions.
Clone the source:

 git clone https://github.com/consultit/p3recastnavigation.git

Enter the source folder and tweak config.ini as desired; in particular, 
you can change the optimization level, as by putting optimize=1 or 2
would compile the support for the debug drawing.
Then executes:
 
 python build.py 
 
Note: p3recastnavigation uses a slightly modified version of "Panda 
Module Builder" by tobspr (https://github.com/tobspr/P3DModuleBuilder)
as build system, so refer to that for more informations.
