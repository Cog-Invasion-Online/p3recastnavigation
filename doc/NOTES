USAGE NOTES
***********
p3Recastnavigation is an attempt to make available the RecastNavigation library 
facilities to the Panda3d engine. 
It is not a "one-to-one" export of the RecastNavigation functionalities, but a 
synthesis of objects and methods which exploit the library to exhibit features 
that deal with more general concepts such as points, paths, areas, links, 
crossing's abilities etc., trying to avoid references to specific elements of 
the library, such as polygons, corridors, filters, queries, nodes etc.. 
In summary, p3Recastnavigation would like to make available to any programmer, 
functionalities of path finding without the need (to a certain extent) to learn 
the peculiar concepts of the underlying library.
To achieve this, it followed the approach used by the comprehensive RecastDemo
application, exploiting much of its code and adapting it to the Panda3D world.

In addition to reading this document, please also refer to the API 
documentation (c++ only) that can be generated with doxygen:

  doxygen Doxyfile 

Also look at the code of the samples (both in python and c++) in the 'samples' 
folder:
- "basic" it is a minimum example of p3Recastnavigation usage
- "test1" shows examples of how to define and use convex volumes and off mesh 
connections
- "test2" shows other module features: setting of creation parameters, 
integration 
with Panda3D objects, custom update, management of obstacles, event management, 
serialization (that is read/write to/from BAM files)

Moreover, it would help to refer to the original documentation and forums of 
RecastNavigation (https://github.com/RecastNavigation/RecastNavigation):
- Discuss Recast & Detour: http://groups.google.com/group/RecastNavigation
- Development blog: http://digestingduck.blogspot.com/
- API documentation that can be generated with doxygen using the "Doxygen" file 
  located in the root of the source code:
  
   doxygen Doxyfile
   
Finally, and very importantly, use the comprehensive RecastDemo program for
experimenting and becoming familiar with the concepts of RecastNavigation.

Framework
---------
p3Recastnavigation distinguishes various objects and elements to work with:

- RNNavMeshManager: this is a unique object (singleton) whose main task is to 
create/destroy RNNavMeshes and RNCrowdAgents

- RNNavMesh: is a PandNode representing the navigation mesh on which they move 
the RNCrowdAgents

- Owner Object: is a NodePath representing a Panda3D model (static) for which 
a navigation mesh is created; an owner object can "own" several RNNavMeshes

- RNCrowdAgent: is a PandNode representing a crowd agent that moves along the 
owner object to reach the target by following the paths tracked down thanks to 
the navigation mesh; NodePaths of 3d models are usually attached to a 
RNCrowdAgent

- Convex Volumes: these represents specific areas of a navigation mesh that 
could have distinct properties from the rest of the mesh

- Off mesh connections: represent one-dimensional links between disjointed 
regions of the navigation mesh, possibly having also distinct properties

- Area types, flags and costs: these are the elements that allow you to set the 
properties of convex volumes and off mesh connections, affecting even 
dynamically, the choice of paths that agents make to go towards their targets

Placement of objects in the scene
---------------------------------
To make possible the simultaneous use of the various features of the module 
(and also for the integration with other Panda3D modules), it was chosen this 
model of placement of the various elements in the scene:

- Reference NodePath: this node is the root under which objects are attached 
  and with respect to which points, distances and movements  are computed; the 
  RNNavMeshManager provides a default reference node;
  
- placement of RNNavMesh, RNCrowdAgent: at the time of creation, they are 
  automatically attached to the default reference NodePath (and to which they 
  have an internal reference); to the RNCrowdAgent(s) can be subsequently 
  attached 3d models;

- placement of Owner Object: this object should be attached manually to the 
  reference node too, especially to allow you to manage various transformations: 
  translation, rotation (along the axis z - heading), (uniform) scaling.

Once attached objects to the reference NodePath, just reparent this to the scene
(usually under the "render" node).

NOTE: Except for the owner object, no transform should be applied to the other 
objects (except the identity one of course).

Other positioning schemes may work but they have not been tested. 
NOTE: if you change the reference NodePath don't forget to set RNNavMeshes' and
RNCrowdAgents' internal reference and to reparent them to it. 

RNNavMeshManager
----------------
The manager is a singleton that can be retrieved through get_global_ptr() method
(static in c++). 
It manages the creation and destruction of any RNNavMesh and RNCrowdAgent, 
maintaining lists of all these created objects, so they can be retrieved at any 
time.

The manager also has the task to set the many parameters to default values 
during these objects' creation. 
In this regard, a method has been made available for specifying these parameters
in textual mode, the syntax of which is specified in the doxygen documentation 
of RNNavMesh and RNCrowdAgent classes. This was done to ease the creation of 
objects in a "data driven" way, that is, for example, by reading parameters from
an xml configuration file. 
For this purpose various methods are provided, that is, those with names like 
"set_parameter*()" or "get_parameter*()".

In addition, the manager is provided with some other utilities: 
- to find the dimensions of the used models (get_bounding_dimensions()) 
- to manage the collisions with the models (get_collision_traverser(), 
  get_collision_ray() etc...); these are used internally, for example for 
  kinematic RNCrowdAgents, but can be used for general purposes toot(see 
  samples).
- to perform a default update (start/stop_default_update()), that is a task 
  which calls all of the RNNavMeshes' update methods, with no possibility of 
  interaction (usually it is used for test purposes).
- to write/read to/from "bam" files the objects of (part of) a scene having its 
  root as the default reference NodePath (write_to/read_from_bam_file()).
  
RNNavMesh
---------
This object corresponds roughly to the underlying navigation mesh.

XXX
A RNNavMesh can only be used after it is initially associated with a proprietary object (a 3D model consists of a mesh of triangles) through set_owner_node_path (), and then assembled by calling the setup () method.
A RNNavMesh can be either SOLO, TILE, OBSTACLE (see RNNavMeshTypeEnum), and may be modified during its life cycle (prior call to cleanup () and then back to setup ()).
A RNNavMesh is associated with a crowd of RNCrowdAgent (s), which shares several characteristics:
