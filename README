p3recastnavigation
******************

p3recastnavigation is project which integrates (some functionality of) 
Recast & Detour libraries (https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation) 
into Panda3d game engine (https://www.panda3d.org) as a extension module.

Recast is state of the art navigation mesh construction toolset for games, while
Detour is a path-finding and spatial reasoning toolkit. 

p3recastnavigation are currently developed and tested on GNU/Linux (Debian 8 - 
jessie) platform. Since there is no platform specific code, it should builds and 
run successfully on other platforms supported by Panda3d.  

p3recastnavigation is a LGPL v3 licensed open source project. A copy of the 
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE is reported into COPYING file.

Basic Usage
***********

p3recastnavigation has several objects to work with:

- RNNavMeshManager: this is a unique object (singleton) whose main task is to 
create/destroy RNNavMeshes and RNCrowdAgents
- RNNavMEsh: represents the nav mesh on which they move the RNCrowdAgents
- RNCrowdAgent: is the agent that moves to reach the target by following the 
paths tracked down thanks to the nav mesh
- Convex volumes: these represent specific areas of the nav mesh and have distinct 
properties from the rest of the nav mesh
- Off mesh connection: represent one-dimensional connections between disjointed 
regions of the nav mesh, possibly having also distinct properties
- Area types, flags and costs: these are the elements that allow you to set the 
properties of convex volumes and off mesh connections, affecting, even dynamically, 
choosing the path that agents follow to their targets

To have a minimal example of use see the "test" application (both in python in c++) 
in the samples folder. To see examples that show a wider range of use see the "main"
applications (always in python and c++).
